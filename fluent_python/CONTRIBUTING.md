# Contributing 
I have setup all the contributors as collaborators.  So I am suggesting that people create thier own branches and commit on those to prevent conflicts. When we are all done with the discussion we can clean up the repo and mergre the best examples to the main branch. <br><br>
I know I did allow for any contributor to merge into the main branch or edit a document like this. <br><br>
Please feel free to improve any of the instructions on the main branch you like.
