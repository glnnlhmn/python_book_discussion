# Contributing 
I have setup all the contributors as collaborators.
<br><br>
We suggest that each user create their own branch and folder based on their github username.<br><br>
For instance, I've created folder 'feoh' and branch 'feoh_fluent_pyhon' for this discussion.<br><br>
When we are all done with the discussion we can clean up the repo and mergre the best examples to the main branch. <br><br>
I know I did allow for any contributor to merge into the main branch or edit a document like this. <br><br>
Please feel free to improve any of the instructions on the main branch you like.
