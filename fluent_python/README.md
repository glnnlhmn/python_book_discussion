## Introduction
In January of 2023 Boston Python under took a discussion of this book. Since Fluent Python is such a large book with almost 1,000 pages it was necessary to break the book into parts. The natural seperation was work with the parts defined by the author these parts are:

- Part I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Structures
- Part II:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Functions as Objects
- Part III:&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes and Protocols
- Part IV:&nbsp;&nbsp;Control Flows
- Part V:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metaprogramming

This repository will contain links code fragements and other resources found useful during the discussion of the material. It is hoped that these notes, links, and code will be useful to any individual exploring the repository. For clarity this document was put together in the form of a journal to document our discovery process. 

## Data Structures

The initial discusion will cover *Data Structures* which run from Pages 1 through 227.  This part of the book is seperated into the following chapters:

1. The Python Data Model

2. An Array of Sequences

3. Dictionaries and Sets

4. Unicode Text Versus Bytes

5. Data Class Builders

6. Objective References, Mutability, and Recycling
