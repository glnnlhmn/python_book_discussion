# Fluent Python Chapter 1 - Python Data Model
## Chris Patti's Notes

* I think it's noteworthy that the French Deck example rather elegantly leverages named tuples. I feel like they're under-utilized, especiaolly by newer Pythonistas, probably because the syntax to define them can feel a little clunky.
* The distinction between "data model" and "object model" discussed in the Soapbox is interesting. Even though 'data' is even more overloaded than 'object' in this context I think data model is actually less confusing and more expressive of what this actually is.
